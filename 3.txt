312051 is somewhere on the 559*559 square (bottom right corner has number 312481).

when you are in the corner, you need (n-1)/2 steps in each direction to get to spot number 1.

so 312051 is on the row 559 => (559-1)/2 = 279 steps up to get to spot number 1.
on the x-axis, 312051 is 430 steps to the left of 312481, so it went (430-279) = 151 steps too far to get directly under spot number one.

so the solution should be 279+151 =
